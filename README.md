# Explainable Machine Learning Framework for Android Malware Detection

## üìå Project Overview
This project addresses the growing threat of Android malware by developing an **explainable machine learning framework** that combines high-performance detection with model transparency. Using the **CICMalDroid 2020** dataset, the system leverages dynamic analysis, multiple classification algorithms, and interpretability tools (SHAP and LIME) to provide actionable insights into malware behavior.

## üìÇ Dataset
- **Source**: CICMalDroid 2020
- **Type**: Dynamic analysis logs
- **Classes**: Multiple malware families and benign samples
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Label encoding
  - Feature normalization
  - Malware category distribution analysis

## ‚öôÔ∏è Models Used
- [x] XGBoost
- [x] Random Forest
- [x] Naive Bayes
- [x] Logistic Regression
- [x] Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- [x] k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- [x] LightGBM

## üß† Explainability
To ensure model transparency and trust, the framework integrates:
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**
- **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)**

These tools highlight the most influential features driving each prediction.
